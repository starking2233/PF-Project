Two Players: The game alternates between two players, Player 1 and Player 2. Player 1 uses the 'X' mark, while Player 2 uses the 'O' mark. User Input: Players are prompted to enter a number corresponding to a position on the board (1 through 9). The input is validated to ensure the selected position is available.
